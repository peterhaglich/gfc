A “national military attack” includes the employment of conventional and unconventional weapons by one country’s national military forces on another country’s military, military assets, or territory, including citizens located within that territory, but excluding territorial waters, foreign missions, and/or exclusive economic zones. A “cyber” attack will not qualify as a “national military attack.” Attacks by specific military or paramilitary units or non-state actors will not qualify as “national military attacks” unless the government claims responsibility for them.\n",
