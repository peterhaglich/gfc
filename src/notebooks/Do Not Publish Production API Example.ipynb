    "# Using Python to Access the Geopolitical Forecasting Challenge 2 API\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Participation in Geopolitical Forecasting (GF) Challenge 2 is conducted through an API provided by Cultivate Labs. This notebook briefly demonstrates some ways to interact with the API through Python. These examples assume that you are familiar with Python 2 or 3, and have installed the [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) library (which is included in distributions such as Anaconda). (NOTE: You may use these examples as part of your Challenge solution, but it is important to note that this code is meant primarily as a reference, and should not be assumed to be bug-free, or particularly efficient. We make no guarantees or warranties that this code will correctly retrieve or submit data to the API -- you are responsible for verifying that your forecasts are submitted correctly).\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to participating in GF Challenge 2, you must register at [HeroX](https://www.herox.com/IARPAGFChallenge2), and then register on the Cultivate platform using the URLs provided. Upon registering on the Cultivate platform, you will be able to generate an API key for the staging (test) instance, and production (competition) instance of the API. This API key is unique to you, and you should ensure that it is not shared with others.  This API key is used to identify and authenticate your requests and submissions to the API.  (*Note that API keys from the first GF Challenge have been deactivated; you will need a new key to participate in GF Challenge 2*.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will find complete [API documentation on the Cultivate Labs site](https://cultivate-hfc.github.io/gfc-api-docs/) once you receive your API key. This notebook does not provide an exhaustive overview of the entire API. Instead, it is designed to highlight some key considerations for implementing a GF Challenge 2 API client. It is not a substitute for a thorough understanding of the API documentation. This document describes some concepts related to the challenge, however, it is not an authoritative source of challenge rules. You are responsible for reviewing and understanding the official GF Challenge 2 Rules document available on the HeroX site.\n",

    "## General Details\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two separate but similar APIs for GF Challenge 2 on the Cultivate Labs platform.  The **Staging** platform (URL https://api.gfc-staging.com) is provided for Solvers to get familiar with the procedures for accessing the data and submitting forecasts in a practice mode.  The **Production** platform (URL https://api.iarpagfchallenge.com) is the platform for the competition.  The two platforms use separate API keys.  It is recommended that you use the Staging platform as you work through the code examples in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using your API Key\n",
    "\n",
    "All calls to the API must include your API key in the request headers in the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "`headers['Authorization'] = 'Bearer ' + secret_token`\n",
    "\n",
    "So, one can submit a GET request to the API this way:"

    "When POSTing forecasts, things look pretty much the same, except it would be formatted with the `.post()` method, and the parameters would be submitted as `json`:\n",
    "\n",
    "`result = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=params)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Passing parameters to the API\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, you'll want to provide specific parameters when making your API calls, (e.g., asking for human forecasts made against a specific forecasting question, requesting information that has been updated since you last checked).  To do that, you will pass a set of parameters in python dictionary form.  The dictionary structure will be identical to the examples provided in the Cultivate API documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, you may want to receive all human forecasts made against question number 5 since May 20, 2019. You would set your params dictionary as:\n",
    "\n",
    "`params = {'question_id':5, 'created_after':'2019-05-20T00:00:00.000Z'}`\n",
    "\n",
    "The full set of required and optional input parameters are listed in the Cultivate API documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recieving Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "When a GET or POST request is successfully executed, you will receive a JSON formatted response which can be accessed as the response's `.json()` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Paging\n",
    "\n",
    "All paginated endpoints will also include 2 pagination-related response headers: `X-Total-Page-Count` and `X-Total-Record-Count`. `X-Total-Page-Count` contains the total number of pages available for your request, while `X-Total-Record-Count` contains the total number of records that will be included across all of those pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can access these through the response's `headers` dictionary:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "result = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)\n",
    "\n",
    "if result.ok:\n",
    "    totalPages = int(resp.headers.get('X-Total-Page-Count',0))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, results are returned for the first page (page 0), updating the `params` dictionary to include `params['page'] = 1` would get the next page.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Primary API Endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieving Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual Forecasting Problems (IFPs) are questions about future events that solvers forecast against, and can be retrieved from the `questions` API endpoint. Each IFP includes, among other fields, an `id` a `description`, a set of `answers`, and a collection of `metadata` as well as starting and ending dates. Questions can be retrieved using a GET request with optional parameters.  The `status` parameter (values: active, closed, all) describes whether an IFP is open for forecast submission.  The several date parameters `created_before`, `created_after`, `updated_before`, and `updated_after` limit the response based on when questions were updated or created. The `training_data` parameter is new to GF Challenge 2 and is used to retrieve IFPs that were part of the HFC program but are not in GF Challenge 2 and which are available for Solvers to train their methods.  (More below).  The `answers` are a list of mutually exclusive, and collectively exhaustive options describing possible IFP outcomes. Forecasts must specify probabilities for each possible outcome that sum to 1.0 (except for binary questions (e.g., yes/no) for which only one option is presented, with the other option being calculated as 1 - Option A).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `metadata` that is returned includes `Domain`, `Topic`, and location information. In GF Challenge 2 the metadata will only be populated as an IFP is closed.  (In the first GF Challenge this metadata was provided when an IFP was launched.)  This metadata is provided *post hoc* to allow Solvers to evaluate their techniques for identifying the region or subject of an IFP but does not figure into scoring in any way, as there are no Domain or Region prizes in GF Challenge 2.  Refer to the [GF Challenge 2 Rules document](NEEDS URL ONCE PUBLISHED) and the API documentation to ensure that you accurately retrieve and handle the relevant fields. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each IFP also includes a list of `clarifications`. This will be populated if there is additional guidance regarding the IFP issued. This can include situations where terms are further defined, or sources of resolution are changed. You should regularly check for updates to this field.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieving Individual and Aggregate Human Forecasts\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the Challenge, solvers will have access to forecasts made by a crowd of human forecasters. These forecasts will be made available in two forms: individual and aggregate.  The individual forecasts are made available through the `prediction_sets` API end point, while the aggregate forecasts are provided through the `consensus_histories` end point. The consensus is calculated using an aggregation algorithm called logit. The logit aggregation method is an extremizing method that uses a weighted geometric mean to aggregate forecasts. Forecaster weights are calculated based on 3 factors: historical accuracy, the frequency with which the forecaster updates his or her forecasts, and whether the forecaster completed a training course. The `consensus_histories` data also serve as the baseline against which Solvers will be compared. More details on the baseline and scoring can be found in the official GF Challenge 2 Rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual forecasts contain the probability forecasts, including a `question_id` that maps to the `id` in from the `questions` endpoint and `membership_guid` which uniquely identifies the human forecaster. Each forecast will include a list of `predictions` reflecting the probabilities that person assigned to each possible answer. The `forecasted_probability` for each answer represents that person's beliefs for each answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consensus aggregations contain a `question_id` and `answer_id` pair that identify a particular answer option. The `normalized_value` for a particular answer reflects the score such that all answers to a particular question will sum to 1.0. This consensus is updated any time a human forecaster makes a new forecast against an IFP. The `consensus_histories` API end point contains a list of these updated consensus scores. The most recent consensus for a particular question reflects the current crowd consensus at that time. NOTE: With the exception of the first time you query this endpoint, you should NOT retrieve `consensus_histories` without specifying a `created_after` parameter.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Data (New in GF Challenge 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two collections of non-competition training data that are available for Solvers to train and backtest their methods.  The training data on the Staging platform includes IFPs, individual human forecasts, and consensus histories for 86 IFPs between December 2018 and March 2019.  All of these IFPs are closed and have been resolved.  The training data on the Production platform consists of these elements for HFC IFPs that launched before the start of the GF Challenge 2 competition and which are not included in the Challenge.  Depending on when you access the Production training data you may have a mixture of open and closed IFPs, especially early in the Challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that `membership_guid` values for the Staging training data will not be reused in GF Challenge 2.  However the `membership_guid` values in the Production platform training data will map to the same forecasters during the competition and are suitable for determining forecaster attributes such as accuracy and update frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submitting Forecasts\n",
    "\n",
    "Forecast submission is done through an HTTP POST. Your forecast must include the `question_id`, an `external_predictor_attributes.method_name`, and `external_predictions_attributes`: a list of dictionaries each containing an `answer_id` and `value` for each of the forecast question's possible alternatives. The sum of the values must equal 1.0. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each Solver is allocated 40 methodological \"slots.\" These slots can be used to represent different strategies for weighting data sources, different algorithms, etc. The `method_name` parameter is used to identify which slot a forecast should be associated with. `method_name` can be up to 50 characters, and will be held constant throughout the challenge (i.e., you cannot add a 41st method). You will be scored on a per `method_name` basis, with only your best performing approach being considered for each prize category. For more details, review the GF Challenge 2 rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "A forecast submission can look like:"
